Finding the probability of a customer buying a term deposit product based on his attributes

About the Dataset: The dataset is from a Portuguese Bank which conducted a direct marketing campaign for a product. The dataset provides information about attributes of customers and their final purchase decision.

About the project:  
1. Explore the data for insights 
2. Model the data for predictions 
3. Find feature importance to see which variables are most relevant.

Assumptions of model: 
1. The skill level of all telemarketers are equal. This often is not the case. 
2. The time of call does not influence purchase decision. This may not be the case. People may be less likely to purchase when busy.
